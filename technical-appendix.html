      <h2>1. Purpose of this appendix</h2>
      <p>
        This appendix explains how the Farming Cost Benefit Analysis Decision Aid works. It is written
        for two audiences. The first audience is farmers and non technical users who want practical
        guidance on how to use the tool and how to read the results. The second audience is technical
        users who want to understand the underlying calculations and assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The example in this appendix is a faba bean soil amendment trial. All costs and benefits are
        presented in Australian dollars (AUD). If you work in another currency you can simply treat
        every AUD value as your own currency and apply the same logic.
      </p>
      <div class="appendix-callout">
        For quick use, focus on Sections 2 and 4. Section 2 describes how each tab in the tool works.
        Section 4 gives a worked faba bean example in plain language. Sections 3 and 5 provide
        technical detail and formulas for analysts and reviewers.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card appendix-section">
      <h2>2. How each tab in the tool works</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Introduction tab</h3>
      <p>
        The Introduction tab describes the overall purpose of the tool and explains that the default
        dataset comes from a faba bean trial. It does not affect any calculations. It is there to
        orient users and to link the tool to a particular project.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Project tab</h3>
      <p>
        The Project tab captures the narrative around the analysis. It has no direct numerical
        effect on the cost benefit indicators but it is essential for documentation and reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key elements include:
      </p>
      <p>
        Project name, project lead, analyst team, partner organisations, and a short summary
        describe who is involved and what is being analysed. The project goal and key objectives
        describe what success looks like. The with project and without project stories set out
        the change pathway, and the stakeholder groups field documents who gains or loses.
      </p>
      <div class="appendix-note">
        For farmers, a good way to think about this tab is to imagine that you are explaining
        the trial to a neighbour. If a neighbour can understand the story, the description is
        clear enough for future readers.
      </div>

      <h3>2.3 Time and risk settings tab</h3>
      <p>
        The Time and risk settings tab defines the time horizon of the analysis, the discount
        rates, adoption levels, and risk assumptions. These settings drive the present value
        calculations in the Results and Simulation tabs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Important fields are:
      </p>
      <p>
        The analysis start year is the calendar year that is treated as year 0 in the cash flow.
        The project start year is when the treatments begin on farm. Years of analysis is the
        number of years over which costs and benefits are counted. The system type determines
        whether results are interpreted per farm or across multiple farms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The discount rate fields (low, base, high) are used for present value calculations and for
        the simulation. The discount schedule by period allows the analyst to vary the low, base,
        and high discount rates across different future periods, for example 2025 to 2034 and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adoption settings (low, base, high) define the share of the target area that takes up the
        treatment. For example, an adoption base of 0.4 means that 40 percent of the target area is
        assumed to adopt at the peak of the adoption curve. These adoption multipliers are used in
        the Results tab and are also varied in the Simulation tab.
      </p>
      <p>
        The risk settings combine into an overall risk that effective benefits are lower than the
        expected benefits. The overall risk low, base, and high fields can be entered directly or
        calculated using the Calculate combined base risk button from component risks such as
        technical risk, non cooperation risk, social risk, financial risk, and management risk.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Outputs tab</h3>
      <p>
        The Outputs tab defines the main physical outputs that matter for the analysis. In a faba
        bean trial this could include yield per hectare and grain quality premiums. For each output
        the tool records a label, a unit (for example tonnes per hectare), and a value per unit in
        AUD. The value per unit is usually a price such as AUD 500 per tonne of grain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool then uses treatment level yield differences to compute benefit flows in AUD using
        the formula:
      </p>
      <div class="appendix-math">
Benefit in AUD = (Output quantity under treatment - Output quantity under control) × Value per unit (AUD)
      </div>

      <h3>2.5 Treatments tab</h3>
      <p>
        The Treatments tab captures each treatment or practice combination. One treatment is flagged
        as the control using the Control vs treatment field. When you select Control the tool treats
        that treatment as the baseline case for comparisons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within each treatment you enter:
      </p>
      <p>
        A clear treatment name and description, the plot or area to which it applies, and any
        treatment specific labour cost in AUD. The labour cost field captures the value of extra
        time or effort required by the practice. For example, manual weeding might require
        additional labour of 4 hours per hectare valued at AUD 30 per hour, for a labour cost of
        AUD 120 per hectare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Output effects at treatment level, such as the change in yield per hectare relative to the
        control, are captured through the Outputs tab and treatment records in the model. Adoption
        is not entered here. Adoption is handled as a scenario setting in the Time and risk settings
        tab and is varied in the Simulation tab.
      </p>

      <h3>2.6 Additional benefits tab</h3>
      <p>
        The Additional benefits tab is used for benefits that are not directly captured by the
        primary outputs. For example this can include reduced pest losses, lower fertiliser costs
        due to improved soil fertility, or improved soil organic matter with a value per hectare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each additional benefit has a label, a unit and a value per unit in AUD. The tool then
        calculates a stream of benefits in AUD over the analysis period in the same way as for
        outputs.
      </p>

      <h3>2.7 Other project costs tab</h3>
      <p>
        The Other project costs tab captures project management and overhead costs that are not
        specific to a single treatment, such as extension activities, coordination, or monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each cost item you define:
      </p>
      <p>
        A label, category, timing, and the annual or periodic cost in AUD. If the item is a capital
        item, such as a piece of equipment, the tab allows you to specify depreciation settings.
        Depreciation is only applied to items in the capital category. For other categories the
        depreciation row is not used because these costs are treated as operating costs.
      </p>

      <h3>2.8 Sources tab</h3>
      <p>
        The Sources tab is used to document and tag data sources for outputs and treatments. It does
        not change any calculations. It helps analysts trace each number back to field notes,
        articles, or datasets. This is useful when the tool is linked to a shared evidence
        repository.
      </p>

      <h3>2.9 Results tab</h3>
      <p>
        The Results tab shows the core economic indicators that are commonly used in cost benefit
        analysis. It reports whole project metrics, a comparison between the control and the combined
        treatment group, rankings of treatments, net present value by analysis horizon, and a
        summary of capital item depreciation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key indicators are:
      </p>
      <p>
        Present value of benefits and costs (PV in AUD), net present value (NPV in AUD),
        benefit cost ratio (BCR), internal rate of return (IRR), modified internal rate of return
        (MIRR), return on investment (ROI), payback period in years, annual gross margin, and gross
        profit margin.
      </p>

      <h3>2.10 Simulation tab</h3>
      <p>
        The Simulation tab runs a Monte Carlo analysis that varies discount rates, adoption,
        risk, and selected cost and benefit inputs within ranges specified on the Time and risk
        settings tab. This provides a distribution of possible NPV and BCR outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tab reports summary statistics such as the minimum, maximum, mean and median NPV and
        BCR in AUD and unitless ratios, as well as the probability that NPV is greater than zero
        and the probability that BCR is greater than a target threshold. Distributions can be
        visualised using histograms of simulated NPV and BCR.
      </p>

      <h3>2.11 Excel import and export tab</h3>
      <p>
        The Excel tab allows users to download a blank template or a sample workbook that reflects
        the current scenario, edit it in Excel, and import it back into the tool. The sample
        workbook includes a faba bean raw data sheet so that the example trial can be reproduced
        and extended.
      </p>
      <p>
        When importing, the tool first parses the workbook and shows whether it can read the
        structure. Once validated, the user can apply the parsed data to the model.
      </p>

      <h3>2.12 Policy brief helper tab</h3>
      <p>
        The Policy brief helper tab builds a structured summary of the current scenario that can
        be copied into another assistant to draft a policy note. It includes the project context,
        key assumptions, economic results in AUD, adoption and risk settings, and key messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The preview box shows the JSON style payload that is copied when the user clicks the Copy
        scenario summary button.

      <h3>3.1 Faba bean trial dataset structure</h3>
      <p>
        The default dataset in the tool is based on a faba bean soil amendment trial with one
        control and several treatments. The data are organised per plot, which can be converted
        to per hectare figures. The table below shows a simplified abstract of the structure used

      <p>
        In the tool the yield and cost differences between each treatment and the control are used
        to calculate net benefits per hectare. These are then scaled up using the adoption settings
        and the number of hectares in the target area.

        <div>
          <span class="appendix-badge">Present value (PV)</span>
          <p>
            Present value converts a stream of future cash flows into a single value today. The tool
            calculates the present value of benefits and the present value of costs separately for
            each scenario using the base discount rate and the defined time horizon.
          </p>

          <div class="appendix-math">
PV of benefits (AUD) = Σt=0..T [ Benefit_t (AUD) ÷ (1 + r)^t ]

      <h3>3.3 Risk combination formula</h3>
      <p>
        When you click Calculate combined base risk the tool combines the component risks into a
        single base risk. A simple multiplicative form is used so that the combined risk reflects
        the chance that all risk factors line up in a way that reduces benefits.
      </p>
      <div class="appendix-math">
Let rTech, rNonCoop, rSocio, rFin, rMan be the component risks between 0 and 1.

Combined base risk R is:

R = 1 - (1 - rTech) × (1 - rNonCoop) × (1 - rSocio) × (1 - rFin) × (1 - rMan)
      </div>
      <p>
        The overall risk base field is then set to R. This means that if each risk is modest the
        combined risk is still moderate, but if many risks are high the combined risk increases
        quickly.
      </p>

      <h3>3.4 Depreciation for capital items</h3>
      <p>
        For capital items the tool applies straight line depreciation over the chosen life. Suppose
        the capital item has an initial cost of AUD 10,000, a salvage value of AUD 1,000, and a
        useful life of 9 years.
      </p>
      <div class="appendix-math">
Annual depreciation (AUD) = (Initial cost (AUD) - Salvage value (AUD)) ÷ Useful life (years)

In the example:

Annual depreciation = (10,000 - 1,000) ÷ 9 = AUD 1,000 per year (rounded)
      </div>
      <p>
        The depreciation summary in the Results tab aggregates these annual depreciation flows for
        all capital items in the scenario.

      <h2>4. Worked faba bean example in AUD (farmer friendly view)</h2>

      <div class="appendix-callout appendix-callout-steps">
        <strong>Scenario description in plain language</strong>
        <p>
          You are a faba bean grower who currently follows a control practice with no soil
          amendments. You are considering a new treatment that combines gypsum, lime, and an
          inoculant. You want to know whether the new treatment is worth its extra cost when
          applied over the next 10 years, expressed in AUD.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>4.1 Step 1: Set up the project story</h3>
      <p>
        On the Project tab enter a short description such as:
      </p>
      <p>
        The project name is Faba bean soil amendment trial. The with project story notes that
        soil structure improves and yields increase on treated paddocks. The without project story
        notes that yields stay at current levels and soil constraints remain.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Step 2: Define time horizon and discount rate</h3>
      <p>
        On the Time and risk settings tab set:
      </p>
      <p>
        Analysis start year: 2025
        <br />
        Project start year: 2025
        <br />
        Years of analysis: 10
        <br />
        Discount rate (base): 7 percent
        <br />
        Discount rate (low): 4 percent
        <br />
        Discount rate (high): 10 percent
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that the tool will count benefits and costs over 10 years, discount future cash
        flows at 7 percent per year in the base case, and use 4 and 10 percent in sensitivity and
        simulation analysis.
      </p>

      <h3>4.3 Step 3: Enter outputs and values in AUD</h3>
      <p>
        On the Outputs tab define a primary output:
      </p>
      <p>
        Output name: Faba bean grain yield
        <br />
        Unit: tonnes per hectare
        <br />
        Value per unit: AUD 600 per tonne
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that an extra 0.2 tonnes per hectare of grain is worth 0.2 × 600 = AUD 120 per
        hectare in additional revenue.
      </p>

      <h3>4.4 Step 4: Enter treatments and labour costs in AUD</h3>
      <p>
        On the Treatments tab create two treatments:
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment 1: Control, flagged as Control in the Control vs treatment field.
        <br />
        Treatment 2: Gypsum plus lime plus inoculant, flagged as Treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose the trial data show:
      </p>
      <p>
        Yield under control: 1.8 tonnes per hectare.
        <br />
        Yield under treatment: 2.4 tonnes per hectare.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference is 0.6 tonnes per hectare. At AUD 600 per tonne this is AUD 360 per hectare
        in extra gross revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now enter the extra labour and input costs for the treatment:
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment labour cost: AUD 70 per hectare for extra application time.
        <br />
        Additional input cost: AUD 190 per hectare for gypsum, lime, and inoculant materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        The net gain per hectare in year 1 is:
      </p>
      <div class="appendix-math">
Extra revenue (AUD/ha) = 0.6 t/ha × AUD 600/t = AUD 360/ha
Total extra cost (AUD/ha) = Labour (70) + Inputs (190) = AUD 260/ha
Net benefit (AUD/ha) = 360 - 260 = AUD 100/ha
      </div>

      <h3>4.5 Step 5: Adoption and target area</h3>
      <p>
        On the Time and risk settings tab set adoption multipliers. Suppose your target area is
        500 hectares of faba bean over time and you expect adoption to reach 40 percent of that
        area at its peak. Enter:
      </p>
      <p>
        Adoption base: 0.4
        <br />
        Adoption low: 0.2
        <br />
        Adoption high: 0.6
      </p>
      <p>
        In the base case this means that at peak adoption about 200 hectares use the new treatment.
        If the net benefit is AUD 100 per hectare then the annual net benefit at peak adoption is
        about AUD 20,000.
      </p>

      <h3>4.6 Step 6: Risk settings</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose you believe there is a 15 percent chance that technical performance is worse than
        expected, a 10 percent chance that cooperation is low, a 5 percent social risk, a 10 percent
        financial risk, and a 10 percent management risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter:
      </p>
      <p>
        Technical risk: 0.15
        <br />
        Non cooperation risk: 0.10
        <br />
        Social risk: 0.05
        <br />
        Financial risk: 0.10
        <br />
        Management risk: 0.10
      </p>
      <p>
        Click Calculate combined base risk. The combined risk R is:
      </p>
      <div class="appendix-math">
R = 1 - (1 - 0.15) × (1 - 0.10) × (1 - 0.05) × (1 - 0.10) × (1 - 0.10)

= 1 - (0.85 × 0.90 × 0.95 × 0.90 × 0.90)
≈ 1 - 0.590 = 0.41 (41 percent)
      </div>
      <p>
        This means that effective benefits are reduced by about 41 percent compared with the ideal
        case. The tool applies this risk factor to the benefit stream.
      </p>

      <h3>4.7 Step 7: Reading the results in AUD</h3>
      <p>
        After entering these values click Recalculate results on the Results tab. The tool will
        show:
      </p>
      <p>
        Present value of benefits (AUD) across all years and adopted area.
        <br />
        Present value of costs (AUD) across all years.
        <br />
        Net present value (AUD), which is the difference between the two.
        <br />
        BCR, IRR, MIRR, ROI, and payback period in years.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a farmer the key questions are:
      </p>
      <p>
        Is NPV positive and sizeable in AUD at the chosen discount rate
        <br />
        Is BCR comfortably above 1
        <br />
        Is the payback period short enough given cash flow and risk tolerance
      </p>
      <p>
        If the answers are yes, the treatment looks attractive in economic terms under the current
        assumptions.
      </p>

      <h3>4.8 Step 8: Exploring uncertainty</h3>
      <p>
        On the Simulation tab you can set the number of runs, for example 2000, and choose whether
        to vary outputs, treatment costs, and other project costs. You can also specify a target BCR,
        for example 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you click Run simulation the tool generates distributions of NPV and BCR in AUD and
        reports:
      </p>
      <p>
        The chance that NPV is greater than zero.
        <br />
        The chance that BCR is greater than 1.
        <br />
        The chance that BCR is greater than the target value.
      </p>
      <p>
        A farmer can interpret these probabilities as the chance that the treatment pays off under
        the ranges of assumptions chosen in the Time and risk settings tab.
      </p>

    <section class="card appendix-section">
      <h2>5. Technical guidance for analysts and future trials</h2>

      <h3>5.1 Data model and units</h3>
      <p>
        Internally the tool represents each outcome and cost as a time indexed cash flow in AUD.
        All project items are converted into streams of net benefits per unit area and then scaled
        up using the area and adoption patterns. The core unit is AUD per year. Adoption is treated
        as a multiplier on the maximum potential area or number of units.
      </p>
      <p>
        When adapting the tool to a new trial the main tasks are:
      </p>
      <p>
        Define outputs that match the new production system and assign AUD values per unit.
        <br />
        Define treatments that reflect the new practices, including treatment specific labour
        costs in AUD and any additional input costs.
        <br />
        Update the Excel template to match the new trial structure if you want to import plot
        level data.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2 Treatment labour cost field</h3>
      <p>
        The labour cost field in the Treatments tab is treated as an annual cost per hectare (or
        per unit if a different unit is specified). It is added to other treatment level costs
        in the benefit cost calculations. Analysts should ensure that labour costs are valued at
        an appropriate wage rate, expressed in AUD, reflecting the opportunity cost of labour.
      </p>

      <h3>5.3 Adoption paths and scaling</h3>
      <p>
        The tool implements simple adoption paths that scale treatment level net benefits from
        per hectare to total benefits at project level. Adoption low, base, and high correspond
        to different adoption trajectories used in the base case and in the simulation.
      </p>
      <div class="appendix-math">
Let Amax be the maximum potential area (ha).
Let aBase be the base peak adoption multiplier between 0 and 1.

Peak adopted area (ha) = Amax × aBase

Annual net benefit (AUD) in year t = Per hectare net benefit (AUD/ha) × Adopted area in year t (ha)
      </div>
      <p>
        Adoption in each year is implemented through a simple ramp up and plateau profile. This
        can be adapted in the code if more complex adoption curves are needed.
      </p>

      <h3>5.4 Simulation engine</h3>
      <p>
        The Monte Carlo simulation draws random values for the discount rate, adoption multiplier,
        risk factor, and optionally for specified cost and benefit fields. Each parameter is drawn
        within its low and high range around the base case value. For example, if the variation
        size is 20 percent the tool samples values uniformly within plus or minus 20 percent of
        the base value.
      </p>
      <div class="appendix-math">
Example for a value X (AUD) and variation size v percent:

Lower bound = X × (1 - v/100)
Upper bound = X × (1 + v/100)

Sampled value = Uniform(Lower bound, Upper bound)
      </div>
      <p>
        For each simulation run the tool recalculates the full cash flow in AUD and computes NPV
        and BCR. It then summarises the distribution of these indicators.
      </p>

      <h3>5.5 Extending the tool to new farming systems</h3>
      <p>
        To apply the tool to another crop or region:
      </p>
      <p>
        Update the Project tab to describe the new system.
        <br />
        Define new outputs that represent the main benefits in AUD, for example crop yield,
        livestock weight gain, or quality premiums.
        <br />
        Create treatments that capture the relevant practices, with appropriate labour and input
        costs in AUD.
        <br />
        Adjust adoption and risk assumptions on the Time and risk settings tab to match local
        conditions.
        <br />
        If needed, adjust Excel templates so that analysts can import the new raw datasets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core economic logic based on AUD remains the same. This means that the tool can be
        reused for a wide range of trial designs as long as all monetary inputs are expressed
        consistently in Australian dollars or treated as equivalent units.
      </p>

      <h3>5.6 Documentation and reproducibility</h3>
      <p>
        Analysts are encouraged to use the Sources tab and the Excel import and export features
        to keep a clear link between field data, assumptions, and the scenario configured in the
        tool. The Save project (JSON) function in the main tool stores the entire scenario,
        including all AUD inputs and settings, so that the analysis can be reproduced or audited
        later.
      </p>

      <div class="appendix-footer-note">
        This technical appendix should be kept together with the JSON scenario files and any Excel
        workbooks used for the analysis so that future users can understand how all numbers in AUD
        were derived and how the results were calculated.
